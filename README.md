## Project Overview
The Tourist Journey app is a smart, interactive platform designed to create a complete and enjoyable museum experience from start to finish. It begins by offering a list of available museums, each accompanied by short summaries, eye-catching images, unique details, and user reviews to help visitors compare and choose the right destination. Once a museum is selected, the app allows users to easily and quickly book tickets directly. Upon arrival, it enhances the visit with interactive tools such as maps, audio or visual guides, and even 3D views of artifacts with concise explanations, adding both educational value and immersion. When the tour ends, the app continues to support the visitor by suggesting nearby souvenir shops with ratings, or places to eat and relax, complete with reviews from other travelers. This way, the app delivers a seamless journey that covers planning, exploring, and post-visit experiences â€” all in one integrated and user-friendly platform, acting as both a smart travel companion and an interactive guide.
